- works good validation is great and i want to know how you do the little animation thingyeyys's

-Also Reed Goodwin- I think he did a great job with the UI, it has a intertaining animation and cool feature to give u a drumroll for your answer. Everything works as intended, i would have added a 4rth choice to grab a totally random one. Other than that its perfect!
